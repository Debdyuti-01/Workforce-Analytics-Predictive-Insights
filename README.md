### Workforce Analytics
Workforce analytics is like having a magnifying glass for understanding your organization's people dynamics. It involves diving into Human Resource (HR) data to enhance workforce performance. Think of it as a talent radar, where HR data is examined closely and linked to organizational goals, showing how HR strategies impact overall success

### Objective
Workforce attrition is all about how many people leave a company and why. We're crunching the numbers to predict who might leave next and why they'd do it.

### Motivation
The project aims to boost employee satisfaction, cut costs, improve performance, and foster a positive workplace culture. Using data and analytics, it's an opportunity to make meaningful changes benefiting both employees and the organization.

#### The methodology for IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-and-Performance-Prediction is as follows:-
```
- Load the Dataset: The IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset is loaded using the pd.read_csv() function. The head() and info() methods are used to display the first few rows and get information about the dataset, respectively

- Knowing the Dataset: Basic Information about the dataset is generated; numerical and categorical attributes are enlisted.
- Data Cleaning: Any missing values in the dataset are dropped using the dropna() method

- Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used to visualize the data

- Statistical Analysis: The ANOVA Test is performed to analyze the Numerical Features' Importance in Employee Attrition, while the Chi-Square Test to Analyze the Categorical Feature Importance in Employee Attrition

- Data Preprocessing: The target variable 'Attrition' is mapped to binary values (1 for 'Yes' and 0 for 'No'). Selected features are extracted from the dataset and one-hot encoded using the get_dummies() function

- Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() method from scikit-learn.
- Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers are initialized and trained using the training data

- Model Evaluation: The accuracy score and confusion matrix are computed to evaluate the performance of each algorithm on the testing data

- Results: The results, including the accuracy and confusion matrix, are printed for each algorithm

- Model Performance Comparison: The hvPlot library is used to visualize the ROC curve diagram comparing the performance of all models used
```

### Dataset
This is a hypothetical dataset created by IBM data scientists. The dataset has (1470R X 35C) that contains numeric and categorical data types describing each employeeâ€™s background and characteristics, and labeled with whether they are still in the company or whether they have gone to work somewhere else
